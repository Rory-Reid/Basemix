    <strong>Important notice: </strong> Basemix does not backup your data. If you lose your data, it is gone forever. If
    you are using an android phone and you clear your app data, or delete the app, or factory reset, your data is gone
    forever.
</p>
<p>
    Use the settings page to manually export your database from time to time. You can also use that page to load a backup
    but be aware that loading a backup will overwrite your current data.
