# Basemix

Basemix is a cross-platform application for rat breeders built using [dotnet MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui). It is a hobbyist project and open to contributions/feedback.

Basemix is built specifically with UK breeders in mind and may not work well for the standards and practices of other breeders. It lets you manage data about your rats, litters, owners and other details, providing helpful estimates and statistics and other functions such as PDF pedigree generation. Data is kept entirely locally in a SQLite database, and can be backed up and restored on other devices easily.
